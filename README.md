# C4-Quiz-KC

## Description

This Challenge's purpose was to code a timed coding quiz that utilized JavaScript and local browser storage. When the quiz is started the user is presented with questions. If the user answers the question incorrectly 15 seconds is removed from the timer. If the timer runs out you lose. If the quiz is completed before the timer runs out the user is prompted to save their initials with their score. Which can then be viewed. This challenge was a fun reassuring reminder that if you put in the work you get the results you want. Through this challenge I have a better understanding of JavaScript and how to save input to local browser storage.
